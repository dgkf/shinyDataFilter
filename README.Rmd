# IDEAFilter 

Built upon [shinyDataFilter](https://github.com/dgkf/shinyDataFilter), which was built on on top of [Joe Cheng](https://github.com/jcheng5)'s excellent [R/Pharma 2018 shiny demo](https://github.com/jcheng5/rpharma-demo).

# Getting started

```

## Example App

shinyAppFile(system.file("examples", "basic_app", "app.R", package = "IDEAFilter"))
```
